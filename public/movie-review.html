<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>3 idiots</h3>

<p>'3 Idiots' is celebrated for its humor, emotional depth, and critique of the Indian education system.<br />Aamir Khan, R. Madhavan, and Sharman Joshi deliver strong performances, and the film's catchphrases resonate.<br /> However, it is criticized for a clich√©d plot, exaggerated scenes, and unrealistic elements.<br />This film is a comedy movie with strong acting, memorable characters, a perplexing storyline and most importantly, highly motivational movie to choose the right path in your life.</p>

<h3>Dhammal</h3>

<p>Inder Kumar's Dhamaal,is on of the cleanest and funniest movies to come out in Bollywood.<br />
Nowadays,we hardly get to see squeaky clean comedy movies.<br />
Dhamaal is a little gem which deserves a watch.This movie was not promoted heavily but soon gain popularity among people and became a super hit at box-office.<br />
Direction by Inder Kumar is very good.<br />
Dialogs are very good.<br />
Performance wise-Javed Jaffery tops with an enthralling performance.Ritesh Deshmukh is very good.Ditto for Arshad Warsi and Ashish Chaudhary.Sanjay Dutt too is excellent.Asrani and Sanjay Mishra are hilarious.Prem Chopra is good in a brief role.<br />
Overall Dhamaal deserves more than once viewing because it is one of those comedies which we hardly get.</p>

<h3>Surya The Soldier</h3>

<p>"Surya The Soldier" is an action-packed Telugu film starring Allu Arjun, released in 2018.<br /> While it's a strong showcase for Allu Arjun's action and star power, the film is not without its flaws, with some critics noting a weaker script and pacing issues.</p>
